# Webscraper project for Arbetsförmedlingen
In this project we gather data about DevOps job ads from the website Arbetsförmedlingen.

We are using Puppeteer, wich is a NodeJs library that offers a webscraping tool.

With Puppeteer, we gather all DevOps jobs in the municipality of Stockholm.
The information that we gather is the job title, name of the company that offers the job, the job description, 
what municipality the company resides in and the link to Arbetsförmedlingen wehere you can read more about the job.

This application was deployed to Heroku: https://webscraperssd.herokuapp.com/

This project was made by Ludvig "LudNyq1" Nyqvist, William "Traktor150" Becker and Kevin "xetr0x" Wilusz.
